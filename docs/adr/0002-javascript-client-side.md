# 1. Javascript for Client Side

Date: 2019-08-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decision to use Javascript on the client-side code of Libero Reviewer.

## Decision

We will use Javascript for writing client-side code on this project.

### Discussion

This took place in a meeting on 2019-08-02 between @diversemix @thewilkybarkid @davidcmoulton @Cooryd @will-byrne

Reviewer is an interactive application and UX will be a lot more quick and thus smooth from a Product point of view. Future requirements of chat and notifications also will necessitate its use.

## Consequences

- We will require all users to have javascript enabled and capable browsers.
